# Integrations

Integrations allow administrators to capture changes and events actioned via the myCloudPBX customer portal or a PBX. 

Using the webhook, external workflows can be called, for example when your client creates a new myCloudPBX extension, creating a callback request inside your CRM for an account manager to complete a wellness check.

A Webhook is a way for 2 applications to communicate and share real-time data. A Webhook works in the same way as an API only in reverse - data is pushed from the application rather than pulled (API).

myCloudPBX Integrations can also be used to provide live data feeds to third-party or external billing systems. 

There are two main types of Integrations that can be enabled.

* **myCloudPBX Integrations:** These integrations are specific to an account.
* **Service Integrations:** This integration is specific to one PBX.

## myCloudPBX Integrations

myCloudPBX Integrations include the following:

* Create User

## Sample Integrations

### Net Promoter Score (NPS)

A Net Promoter Score (NPS) Application is an example of something that can easily be create by making use of the '**IVR Selected**' webhook trigger.

#### Configuration

To create the required application you would need to do a few things.

1. Enable the '**IVR Selected**' Webhook and configure the '**Request URL**' to point to your webserver.

2. Create an IVR in myCloudPBX to capture the NPS score.

3. Create a virtual extension specifically for the newly created IVR.

4. Write a basic application to accept the webhook data on your webserver.
   Your application can then enter the data into your CRM (via API), or send an email to the appropriate person, based on the score received (option selected), with the following information.

     * IVR Name

     * Option Selected
     * Call UUID
     * Source Number
     * Destination Number
     * Date/Time
   You can then take appropriate actions from there.

::: tip 
**Pro Tip:** Use the preview API to download the call recording for the call based on the call UUID and upload it into your CRM or attach it to an email.
:::

5. When you want someone to leave a score, transfer the caller to the virtual extension.
