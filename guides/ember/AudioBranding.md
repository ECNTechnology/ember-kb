myCloudPBX is wholly owned and developed by our team at ECN/Cadiz3/Channel Haus.

## What details do you need for On-Hold Marketing, Auto Attendant, and Out of Hours productions?

While we cannot discuss our customers configuration without specific authorisation, all PBXs provided by myCloudPBX come with 'Music on Hold' functionality, Auto Attendant, and Out of Hours compatability.

## Is myCloudPBX compatible with external media players, online streaming services?

For security and reliability we only support local media stored on our servers and do not access any remotely hosted media.

## How are audio files loaded onto the system?

All files can be loaded via the EMBER Portal.

## What file format does myCloudPBX require?

All files must be in .wav format.

## Are there any length restrictions for Music On Hold

There are no length restrictions for the Music on Hold streams, however we recommend up to 10 minutes.

## Is a site visit necessary, or can this be done remotely?

myCloudPBX is fully configured via our online Portal EMBER, so no site visits are required.

Once the new files are uploaded, and the changes applied, they will take affect immediately.
